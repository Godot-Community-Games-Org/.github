## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a community of game creators making open source games together in Godot. Not affiliated with the Godot Foundation, just community Godudes and Godudettes.

Let's chat on the Discussions page! Come say hi and we can work on figuring out how this whole thing will work and what guidelines we'll follow and all that fun logistics stuff!

And eventually we'll figure out what game (or games! no reason everyone needs to work on a single game) to build!
