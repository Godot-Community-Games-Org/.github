## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a community of game creators making open source games together in Godot. Not affiliated with the Godot Foundation, just a community of Godudes and Godudettes.

Let's chat on the Discussions page and the Discord server (invite link: https://discord.gg/BxudvMV2)
Come say hi and we can work on figuring out how this whole thing will work and what guidelines we'll follow and all that fun logistics stuff!

And eventually we'll figure out what game (or games! no reason everyone needs to work on a single game) to build!

<br>

Goals for this community:
- Build games together and have fun
- Be a learning resource for Godot game creators
- Be inclusive to new Godot devs just getting started
- Be a place where members can meet other game creators and even form their own groups outside of this community to make their own personal group games

<br>

Latest updates:
1. Thanks go to StrawberrySmoothieDev who created a "Godot Community Game Development Project" Discord. Invite link: https://discord.gg/BxudvMV2

<br>

Some upcoming To-Dos for this org:

1. Get interested parties from the reddit thread all added as organization members, and you all join the Discord server and say hi.
2. Discuss (either here in the Discussions section or on the Discord) the general rules and guidelines of how this community will operate so that making games in groups doesn't become a copmlete mess, and add those decisions to this README for easy viewing.
3. Once we have the guidelines in place, focus on dicussing game ideas and what game projects to start up.
4. Have fun and build games together!

Primordial (work in progress) state of Community and Development Guidelines

<br>

General Guidelines:
1. Be excellent to each other.
2. Games MUST have dragons (slightly joking)
3. No usage of AI for assets or code. We have a whole community to make assets and write code.
4. Use of other people's free asset packs is only for prototyping games. 100% of final games are done by contributors to this community.
5. No commercialization of any projects in this github organization. All games are released online for free. If you want to make commercial games with members of the community feel free to form those groups here, but all your work must be separate from this community and therefore done on your own and off this github.
6. Game idea discussion process...

<br>

Style / Development Guidelines:
1. Follow the official Godot style guide (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
2. Standardized script layout...

2. Repos for any potential community-made Godot addons
