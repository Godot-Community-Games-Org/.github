# Hi there and Welcome to the Godot Community Games Organization ðŸ‘‹

This is a community of game creators making open source games together in Godot. Not affiliated with the Godot Foundation, just a community of Godudes and Godudettes.

We just started up this community on Oct 5th, so we are still in the setting up phase.

<br><br>

# New to the community?

### Joining the community:
1. If you aren't a member of this github organization yet and want to join the community, email godot.community.games@gmail.com, please state in your email that you would like to join the group and include your github username. If you are new to Github (or Git itself) check out some of the links on this page -> (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) to get started.
2. Head over to our Discord server (invite link: https://discord.gg/BxudvMV2) to join the community discussion.
3. Fill out this email form (https://forms.gle/WQjPfXPYveGaGzAf7) so you can be given access to the google docs where we keep the Game Design Docs. You will be able to comment on the docs. Emails are only added to the group from this form so please do this. The email list is only used for giving people access to the Game Design Docs.

### Current Events in the community you need to know about:
- We are discussing community and development guidelines this week. Go to the Discord to join the discussion in the "Community Guidelines" channels under the "initial-direction-and-planning" forum. We are hoping to have the guidelines agreed upon by Monday Oct 14th, at which point the finalized Guidelines will be added to this README for all to see.
- We are discussing game ideas on Discord in the "game-idea-discussions" section.
- We also have Game Design Documents being made on google docs. As we hash out ideas for each game in the Discord chats those ideas will be added to these game design docs. Once you have filled out the email form (in #3 above) you can access the Game Design Docs from Discord in the "Links to Game Design Docs on google docs" chat in the "game-idea-discussions" forum there.
- We will be voting on a logo for this community in the coming weeks. So once you have joined, if you want to take a shot at making a logo please submit it on Discord in the "Logo Design" chat under the "initial-direction-and-planning" forum.
- Once we have the guidelines in place, and once we have some fairly mature game ideas, we will vote on which game to start first. Voting will likely take place on github here in the "Discussions" section above.

# Goals for this community
- Build and release games together and have fun
- Be a learning resource for Godot game creators
- Be inclusive to new Godot devs just getting started
- Be a place where members can meet other game creators and even form their own groups to build their own personal games outside of this community

<br><br>

# Outline of Community and Development Guidelines
Finalized guidelines will be added next week once guideline discussions on Discord have completed.

### General Guidelines:
1. Be excellent to each other.
2. Games MUST have dragons (slightly joking)
3. No usage of AI for assets or code. We have a whole community to make assets and write code.
4. Use of other people's free asset packs is only for prototyping games. 100% of final games are done by contributors to this community.
5. No commercialization of any projects in this github organization. All games are released online for free. If you want to make commercial games with members of the community feel free to form those groups here, but all your work must be separate from this community and therefore done on your own and off this github.
6. Game idea discussion process...

### Style / Development Guidelines:
1. Follow the official Godot style guide (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
2. Standardized script layout...
3. Game Directory Structure...
4. Documentation / Comments guide...
5. Commit message labeling guide...

### Contributing Guidelines:
1. Use Github Issues for each repo
2. Use branches and pull requests
3. Code review and merge process...

# Repositories Guide
These are the types of repositories we will be hosting.
- Repos for each game we are building
- Repos for prototypes of games
- A Development Tools repo for any tools made by the community that will be convenient for development (https://github.com/Godot-Community-Games-Org/Development-Tools)
- A Community Asset Repository for storing community-made graphical and audio assets, template scripts, reusable (composable) scenes, visual effects, and any other kind of asset that can be reused for prototyping and development (https://github.com/Godot-Community-Games-Org/Community-Asset-Repository)
- In the future we may have repos for any potential community-made Godot addons
