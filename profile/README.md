## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a community of game creators making open source games together in Godot. Not affiliated with the Godot Foundation, just a community of Godudes and Godudettes.

Let's chat on the Discussions page and the Discord server (invite link: https://discord.gg/BxudvMV2)
Come say hi and we can work on figuring out how this whole thing will work and what guidelines we'll follow and all that fun logistics stuff!

And eventually we'll figure out what game (or games! no reason everyone needs to work on a single game) to build!


Goals for this community:
- Build games together and have fun
- Be a learning resource for Godot game creators
- Be inclusive to new Godot devs just getting started
- Be a place where members can meet other game creators and even form their own groups outside of this community to make their own personal group games



Latest updates:
1. Thanks go to StrawberrySmoothieDev who created a "Godot Community Game Development Project" Discord. Invite link: https://discord.gg/BxudvMV2



Some upcoming To-Dos for this org:

1. Get interested parties from the reddit thread all added as organization members, and you all join the Discord server and say hi.
2. Discuss (either here in the Discussions section or on the Discord) the general rules and guidelines of how this community will operate so that making games in groups doesn't become a copmlete mess, and add those decisions to this README for easy viewing.
3. Once we have the guidelines in place, focus on dicussing game ideas and what game projects to start up.
4. Have fun and build games together!
